#' A dataset containing daily discharge values estimated using a rating curve
#' fitted to 20 data points for the combined outflows from Lough Feeagh, Mill
#' Race and Salmon Leap. Discharge estimates were calculated using Irish
#' Environmental Protection Agency Lough Feeagh water level data (1976-03-04 to
#' 2021-03-07). Note, that owing to gaps in water level records, concurrent gaps
#' occur in the rating curve calculated discharge.
