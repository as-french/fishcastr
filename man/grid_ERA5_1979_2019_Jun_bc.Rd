\description{
A grid containing bias adjusted daily mean air temperature at 2m, daily total
precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (calculated using the
Hargreaves-Samani equation). Data were obtained from the Copernicus Climate
Data Store gridded reanalysis dataset. Dates 1979-01-01 to 2019-06-30. These
grid data are posterior bias adjusted and rounded to 2 decimal places. Data
were bias adjusted using leave-one-out cross validation and empirical
quantile mapping implemented in downscaleR::biasCorrection. Data were
primarily bias adjusted against measurements Met Ã‰ireann's Furnace manual
weather station at Burrishoole; however, gaps were filled in the manual
station data using a nearby automatic station (2005-present) and EWEMBI
gridded pseudo-observations (1979-2016) (see raw-data documentation for
grid_met_obs_1979_2019).
