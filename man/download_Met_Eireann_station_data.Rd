\description{
A function to download meteorological observations (manual and
automatic) from two stations near the south shore of Lough Feeagh,
Burrishoole, Co. Mayo, Ireland. The manual station data range from
1959-11-01 to present and the auto station data range from 2005-02-22 to
present. This function subsets both the raw manual station data and the
auto station data to 2019-12-31 and calculates mean air temperature from
max and min daily values. Resultant .rds datasets are stored in the extdata
folder of the fishcastr package.
