	abstract = {The present study investigated whether there is a critical length of photoperiod needed to stimulate a completed parr-smolt transformation (PST) in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In two experiments, S. salar parr of the Norwegian aquaculture strain held on continuous light were exposed to a short photoperiod (6 L:18D) followed by exposure to 8 L:16D, 12 L:12D, 16 L:8D, 20 L:4D and 24 L:0D in experiment 1 or to 6 L:18D followed by maintenance on 6 L:18D or exposure to 12 L:12D and 24 L:0D photoperiods in experiment 2. All groups, irrespective of photoperiod treatment, developed improved hypo-osmoregulatory ability. However, the development was greatest in the groups exposed to 20 L:4D and 24 L:0D in experiment 1 and 24 L:0D in experiment 2. In experiment 2, gill Na\textsuperscript{+} K\textsuperscript{+}-ATPase activity increased in the group exposed to 24 L:0D, but not in the groups exposed to 12 L:12D and 6 L:18D. The groups exposed to 20 L:4D and 24 L:0D in experiment 1 and 24 L:0D in experiment 2 also grew better than fish exposed to shorter photoperiods. In experiment 2 only the group exposed to 24 L:0D showed a decrease in condition factor and increases in plasma growth hormone and brain type 2 deiodinase mRNA abundance. Hence, only the groups exposed to photoperiods above 16 L:8D developed classical smolt indices in the present experiment, leading us to conclude that the photoperiod increase needs to exceed 16 h daylight for stimulating a complete PST in the S. salar used in the present study.},

	abstract = {Temperature control of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolt migration was tested using a novel technique allowing nearly continuous monitoring of behavior with complete control over environmental conditions. Parr and presmolts were implanted with passive integrated transponder tags, placed in simulated streams, and monitored for upstream and downstream movements. Beginning 18 April, temperature was increased 1 \degreeC every third day (advanced), fourth day (ambient), and tenth day (delayed). Smolt downstream movements were initially low, peaked in mid-May, and subsequently declined under all conditions. Parr downstream movements were significantly lower than those of smolts in all treatments (0.8 {\pm} 0.5 movements day\textsuperscript{-1} versus 26.5 {\pm} 4.5 movements day\textsuperscript{-1}, mean {\pm} SE) and showed no increase. At delayed temperatures, smolts sustained downstream movements through July; those under ambient and advanced conditions ceased activity by mid-June. Initiation and termination of downstream movements occurred at significantly different temperatures but at the same number of degree-days in all treatments. Physiological changes associated with smolting (gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and plasma thyroxine) were coincident with behavioral changes. This is the first evidence of a behavioral component to the smolt window. We found that temperature experience over time is more relevant to initiation and termination of downstream movement than a temperature threshold.},

	abstract = {The production of marine protein from fishing and aquaculture is influenced by environmental conditions. Ocean temperature, for example, can change the growth rate of cultured animals, or the distribution of wild stocks. In turn these impacts may require changes in fishing or farming practices. In addition to short-term environmental fluctuations, long-term climate-related trends are also resulting in new conditions, necessitating adjustment in fishing, farming and management approaches. Longer-term climate forecasts, however, are seen as less relevant by many in the seafood sector owing to more immediate concerns. Seasonal forecasts provide insight into upcoming environmental conditions, and thus allow improved decision making. Forecasts based on dynamic ocean models are now possible and offer improved performance relative to statistical forecasts, particularly given baseline shifts in the environment as a result of climate change. Seasonal forecasting is being used in marine farming and fishing operations in Australia, including wild tuna and farmed salmon and prawns, to reduce uncertainty and manage business risks. Forecast variables include water temperature, rainfall and air temperature, and are considered useful up to approximately 4 months into the future, depending on the region and season of interest. Species-specific habitat forecasts can also be made by combining these environment forecasts with biological habitat preference data. Seasonal forecasts are useful when a range of options are available for implementation in response to the forecasts. The use of seasonal forecasts in supporting effective marine management may also represent a useful stepping stone to improved decision making and industry resilience at longer timescales.},

	abstract = {The fishery for American lobster is currently the highest-valued commercial fishery in the United States, worth over US\$620 million in dockside value in 2015. During a marine heat wave in 2012, the fishery was disrupted by the early warming of spring ocean temperatures and subsequent influx of lobster landings. This situation resulted in a price collapse, as the supply chain was not prepared for the early and abundant landings of lobsters. Motivated by this series of events, we have developed a forecast of when the Maine (USA) lobster fishery will shift into its high volume summer landings period. The forecast uses a regression approach to relate spring ocean temperatures derived from four NERACOOS buoys along the coast of Maine to the start day of the high landings period of the fishery. Tested against conditions in past years, the forecast is able to predict the start day to within one week of the actual start, and the forecast can be issued 3-4 months prior to the onset of the high-landings period, providing valuable lead-time for the fishery and its associated supply chain to prepare for the upcoming season. Forecast results are conveyed in a probabilistic manner and are updated weekly over a 6-week forecasting period so that users can assess the certainty and consistency of the forecast and factor the uncertainty into their use of the information in a given year. By focusing on the timing of events, this type of seasonal forecast provides climate-relevant information to users at time scales that are meaningful for operational decisions. As climate change alters seasonal phenology and reduces the reliability of past experience as a guide for future expectations, this type of forecast can enable fishing industry participants to better adjust to and prepare for operating in the context of climate change.},

	abstract = {Managers of wildfire-prone landscapes in the Euro-Mediterranean region would greatly benefit from fire weather predictions a few months in advance, and particularly from the reliable prediction of extreme fire seasons. However, in some cases model biases prevent from a direct application of these predictions in an operational context. Fire risk management requires precise knowledge of the likely consequences of climate on fire risk, and the interest for decision-makers is focused on multi-variable fire danger indices, calculated through the combination of different model output variables. In this paper we consider whether the skill in dynamical seasonal predictions of one of the most widely applied of such indices (the Canadian Fire Weather Index, FWI) is sufficient to inform management decisions, and we examine various methodological aspects regarding the calibration of model outputs prior to its verification and operational applicability. We find that there is significant skill in predicting above average summer FWI in parts of SE Europe at 1month lead time, but poor skill elsewhere. These results are largely linked to the predictability of relative humidity. Moreover, practical recommendations are given for the use of empirical quantile mapping in probabilistic seasonal FWI forecasts. Furthermore, we show how researchers, fire managers and other stakeholders can take advantage of a new open-source climate service in order to undertake all the necessary steps for data download, post-processing, analysis and verification in a straightforward and fully reproducible manner.},

	abstract = {Mass migrations are found throughout the animal kingdom and are often undertaken by coordinated social groups. However, surprisingly little is known about how social interactions influence migratory timing. Anadromous fishes such as salmon make extensive breeding migrations between marine and freshwater ecosystems. Returning adult salmon tend to move in discrete temporal pulses, which are typically thought to be triggered by abiotic environmental stimuli (e.g. changes in river flow or temperature). However, most studies reveal only weak correlations between abiotic factors and the timing of spawning runs. Here, we demonstrate that social interactions provide a plausible alternative or additional explanation for such patterns. We first provide an example of the phenomenon using 20 years of data on sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, ascending a stream in pulses in the absence of any obvious environmental triggers. Next, we present a model that reproduces the pulses observed in the data, simply by including social interactions among individuals. Deviations between the empirical data and the social model results suggest that salmon may alter their individual behaviour in response to annual fluctuations in density. We hope our results, demonstrating the role that social influence can play on migration timing, will motivate further studies exploring how social interactions may shape the movements of other migratory taxa. Understanding how individuals integrate social information with internal and exogenous drivers of migratory behaviour is vital, particularly in the face of a changing climate, which is changing both the cues used for, and the optimal timing of, migrations.},

Differences with respect to sampling design and choice of molecular markers, combined with a lack of power estimates, complicate comparisons of existing results. In this study we have used six microsatellite markers and, for the first time, compared maturing silver eels of known age from southern and northern Europe (Italy and Baltic Sea). In comparison with previous studies, our data may give a better representation of potential spawning stocks because eels were sampled when having begun their migration toward the presumed spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. Despite large sample sizes (404 and 806 individuals) we could not observe any signs of genetic differentiation (average FST=-0.00003, P=0.61), and a power analysis showed that the true level of heterogeneity (if existing) must be exceedingly small to have remained undetected (say, FST {\textless}0.0004). A tendency for slightly increased genetic differences between cohorts over time could be seen, but the amount of temporal change was minor and not statistically significant. Our findings reiterate the notion that previous reports of continental genetic differentiation in the European eel may be largely explained by uncontrolled temporal variation between juvenile glass eel samples.},

	abstract = {The spawning migration of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) to the Sargasso Sea is one of the greatest animal migrations. However, the duration and route of the migration remain uncertain. Using fishery data from 20 rivers across Europe, we show that most eels begin their oceanic migration between August and December. We used electronic tagging techniques to map the oceanic migration from eels released from four regions in Europe. Of 707 eels tagged, we received 206 data sets. Many migrations ended soon after release because of predation events, but we were able to reconstruct in detail the migration routes of {\textgreater}80 eels. The route extended from western mainland Europe to the Azores region, more than 5000 km toward the Sargasso Sea. All eels exhibited diel vertical migrations, moving from deeper water during the day into shallower water at night. The range of migration speeds was 3 to 47 km day\textsuperscript{-1}. Using data from larval surveys in the Sargasso Sea, we show that spawning likely begins in December and peaks in February. Synthesizing these results, we show that the timing of autumn escapement and the rate of migration are inconsistent with the century-long held assumption that eels spawn as a single reproductive cohort in the springtime following their escapement. Instead, we suggest that European eels adopt a mixed migratory strategy, with some individuals able to achieve a rapid migration, whereas others arrive only in time for the following spawning season. Our results have consequences for eel management.
Fresh data on the timing and speed of the oceanic spawning migration of European eels suggest a new paradigm for spawning ecology.

Efficiency of prediction was 58?95\% depending on the proportion of the run targeted. The onset of migration was correlated with sunshine hours, August temperature and discharge. Julian days (i.e. photoperiod) was significantly correlated with migration days, indicating between?year similarity in the dynamics of the runs.

	abstract = {The population of European silver eel Anguilla anguilla has declined tremendously in the last decades. The cause of this decline is unknown, and it is necessary to investigate the migratory behaviour and survival rates of silver eels during the reproductive migration in order to understand if the decline is related to factors acting during that migration. We estimated survival and progression rates of European silver eel migrating in the lower part of the River Gudenaa and during the first phase of the marine migration in the Randers Fjord in Denmark. Fifty migrating silver eel (total body length: 56 to 84 cm) were captured, and each was equipped with an acoustic transmitter. Their migration was subsequently monitored using an array of automatic listening stations, and progression rate and mortality in the river, inner part of the fjord and outer part of the fjord were estimated. Survival was high in fresh water. However, 60\% of eels were lost in the inner and outer fjord, supporting the hypothesis that mortality is large in the early phase of the marine migration and that fishing may be a major cause of mortality of silver eels. There was no indication that the slowest-migrating individuals were more prone to fishing mortality than the faster-migrating individuals. Progression rate increased as the eels proceeded downriver and out of the fjord. The migration was predominantly nocturnal, both in the river and fjord. Based on the available evidence, a considerable increase in eel survival in the river-fjord system will be needed in order to fulfil the goals in the European Union recovery plan for eels.},

	abstract = {Brown trout Salmo trutta is endemic to Europe, western Asia and north-western Africa; it is a prominent member of freshwater and coastal marine fish faunas. The species shows two resident (river-resident, lake-resident) and three main facultative migratory life histories (downstream-upstream within a river system, fluvial-adfluvial potamodromous; to and from a lake, lacustrine-adfluvial (inlet) or allacustrine (outlet) potamodromous; to and from the sea, anadromous). River-residency v. migration is a balance between enhanced feeding and thus growth advantages of migration to a particular habitat v. the costs of potentially greater mortality and energy expenditure. Fluvial-adfluvial migration usually has less feeding improvement, but less mortality risk, than lacustrine-adfluvial or allacustrine and anadromous, but the latter vary among catchments as to which is favoured. Indirect evidence suggests that around 50\% of the variability in S. trutta migration v. residency, among individuals within a population, is due to genetic variance. This dichotomous decision can best be explained by the threshold-trait model of quantitative genetics. Thus, an individual's physiological condition (e.g., energy status) as regulated by environmental factors, genes and non-genetic parental effects, acts as the cue. The magnitude of this cue relative to a genetically predetermined individual threshold, governs whether it will migrate or sexually mature as a river-resident. This decision threshold occurs early in life and, if the choice is to migrate, a second threshold probably follows determining the age and timing of migration. Migration destination (mainstem river, lake, or sea) also appears to be genetically programmed. Decisions to migrate and ultimate destination result in a number of subsequent consequential changes such as parr-smolt transformation, sexual maturity and return migration. Strong associations with one or a few genes have been found for most aspects of the migratory syndrome and indirect evidence supports genetic involvement in all parts. Thus, migratory and resident life histories potentially evolve as a result of natural and anthropogenic environmental changes, which alter relative survival and reproduction. Knowledge of genetic determinants of the various components of migration in S. trutta lags substantially behind that of Oncorhynchus mykiss and other salmonines. Identification of genetic markers linked to migration components and especially to the migration-residency decision, is a prerequisite for facilitating detailed empirical studies. In order to predict effectively, through modelling, the effects of environmental changes, quantification of the relative fitness of different migratory traits and of their heritabilities, across a range of environmental conditions, is also urgently required in the face of the increasing pace of such changes.},

	abstract = {To predict how climate change will influence populations, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms, particularly microevolution and phenotypic plasticity, that allow populations to persist in novel environmental conditions. Although evidence for climate-induced phenotypic change in populations is widespread, evidence documenting that these phenotypic changes are due to microevolution is exceedingly rare. In this study, we use 32 years of genetic data (17 complete generations) to determine whether there has been a genetic change towards earlier migration timing in a population of pink salmon that shows phenotypic change; average migration time occurs nearly two weeks earlier than it did 40 years ago. Experimental genetic data support the hypothesis that there has been directional selection for earlier migration timing, resulting in a substantial decrease in the late-migrating phenotype (from more than 30\% to less than 10\% of the total abundance). From 1983 to 2011, there was a significant decrease over threefold in the frequency of a genetic marker for late-migration timing, but there were minimal changes in allele frequencies at other neutral loci. These results demonstrate that there has been rapid microevolution for earlier migration timing in this population. Circadian rhythm genes, however, did not show any evidence for selective changes from 1993 to 2009.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon migration timing can drive population productivity, ecosystem dynamics, and human harvest. Nevertheless, little is known about long-term variation in salmon migration timing for multiple species across broad regions. We used long-term data for five Pacific salmon species throughout rapidly warming southeast Alaska to describe long-term changes in salmon migration timing, interannual phenological synchrony, relationships between climatic variation and migratory timing, and to test whether long-term changes in migration timing are related to glaciation in headwater streams. Temporal changes in the median date of salmon migration timing varied widely across species. Most sockeye populations are migrating later over time (11 of 14), but pink, chum, and especially coho populations are migrating earlier than they did historically (16 of 19 combined). Temporal trends in duration and interannual variation in migration timing were highly variable across species and populations. The greatest temporal shifts in the median date of migration timing were correlated with decreases in the duration of migration timing, suggestive of a loss of phenotypic variation due to natural selection. Pairwise interannual correlations in migration timing varied widely but were generally positive, providing evidence for weak region-wide phenological synchrony. This synchrony is likely a function of climatic variation, as interannual variation in migration timing was related to climatic phenomenon operating at large- (Pacific decadal oscillation), moderate- (sea surface temperature), and local-scales (precipitation). Surprisingly, the presence or the absence of glaciers within a watershed was unrelated to long-term shifts in phenology. Overall, there was extensive heterogeneity in long-term patterns of migration timing throughout this climatically and geographically complex region, highlighting that future climatic change will likely have widely divergent impacts on salmon migration timing. Although salmon phenological diversity will complicate future predictions of migration timing, this variation likely acts as a major contributor to population and ecosystem resiliency in southeast Alaska.},

	abstract = {A Poisson process is a commonly used starting point for modeling stochastic variation of ecological count data around a theoretical expectation. However, data typically show more variation than implied by the Poisson distribution. Such overdispersion is often accounted for by using models with different assumptions about how the variance changes with the expectation. The choice of these assumptions can naturally have apparent consequences for statistical inference. We propose a parameterization of the negative binomial distribution, where two overdispersion parameters are introduced to allow for various quadratic mean-variance relationships, including the ones assumed in the most commonly used approaches. Using bird migration as an example, we present hypothetical scenarios on how overdispersion can arise due to sampling, flocking behavior or aggregation, environmental variability, or combinations of these factors. For all considered scenarios, mean-variance relationships can be appropriately described by the negative binomial distribution with two overdispersion parameters. To illustrate, we apply the model to empirical migration data with a high level of overdispersion, gaining clearly different model fits with different assumptions about mean-variance relationships. The proposed framework can be a useful approximation for modeling marginal distributions of independent count data in likelihood-based analyses.},

We found the sedentary yellow phase in spring, the migratory silver phase in autumn, while August was a cross-over month. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to characterise the morphological and physiological changes that accompany silvering in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.). Silvering is positively related to external parameters such as eye size, internal maturation parameters like GSI, vitellogenine (VIT), and blood-substrates such as phospholipids, Free Fatty Acids (FFA), and cholesterol. The Hepatosomatic Index was not significantly different between yellow and silver groups. In contrast, a significant difference was observed for parameters of body constitution (fat, protein, dry matter) between yellow and silver stages. Furthermore, the process of silvering is accompanied with increased levels of cortisol in autumn, which plays a role in mobilisation of metabolic energy from body stores towards migratory activity and gonadal growth. Based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with physiological, morphological and endocrinological parameters, it is concluded that during the process of silvering, several developmental stages can be recognised, with a timeframe of the premigratory sedentary yellow phase from April until July, August is a cross-over month, and the migratory silver phase is found from September until November.},

This true metamorphosis involves a number of different physiological functions (osmoregulatory, reproductive), which prepare the eel for the long return trip to the Sargasso Sea. Unlike smoltifica-tion in salmonids, silvering of eels is largely unpredictable. It occurs at various ages (females: 4{\textendash}20 years; males 2{\textendash}15 years) and sizes (body length of females: 50{\textendash}100 cm; males: 35{\textendash}46 cm) (Tesch 2003). It is most common when studying eels, to separate individuals into two groups, yellow (resident) and silver (presumably migrant), and to compare the physiological profiles between the two. Basic knowledge was obtained in this way and we will first review what is known about these two stages.Because of the difficulty of getting individuals while they are in the process of metamorphosing, little is known about the dynamics of the silvering process. Here we present new information on the triggers, duration and succession of events up to the silver migratory stage. The transitional stages between the yellow (resident) stage and the silver (migrating) stage were characterized through exhaustive sampling of both resident and migratory eels. New aspects concerning the endocrinology of the silvering process will be given based on seasonal sampling of eels undergoing metamorphosis. These results will also bring new insights on the triggers and timing of silvering.},

These data are frequently used for detecting changes in the timing of bird migration that may relate to recent climate change. We present an overview of problematic issues in the analysis of these data, and review approaches to and methods for characterizing bird migration phenology and its change over time. Methods are illustrated and briefly compared using autumn data on garden warbler Sylvia borin from a standardized mist-netting programme at Lista bird observatory, southern Norway. Bird migration phenology is usually characterized rather coarsely using a small number of sample statistics such as mean, median and selected quantiles. We present 2 alternative approaches. Smoothing methods describe the within-season pattern in the data at an arbitrary level of detail, while fitting a parametric seasonal distribution curve offers a coarse description of migration phenology relatively robust to sampling effects. Various methods for analyzing linear trends in the timing of bird migration are reviewed and discussed. Exploratory studies using longterm data gathered at bird observatories can yield more detailed insight into the phenomenon of bird migration and how phenologies relate to climate. Methodological advances are needed, particularly in order to better characterize the shape of phenological distributions and separate between sampling effects and 'true' phenology.},

Among the three length-groups, significant differences were found in smolt-to-adult survival in each river. In pairwise comparisons, long smolts had significantly higher survival rates than middle-sized and short smolts for both rivers. Among the three condition groups, significant differences were found in smolt-to-adult survival for the Ellidaar but not for the Vesturdalsa. Ages of smolts in the Ellidaar ranged from 1 to 5 years, and more than 98\% of smolts were age 2{\textendash}4. Smolts in the Vesturdalsa ranged in age from 2 to 7 years, and more than 99\% of smolts were age 3{\textendash}5.

Among the three migration timing groups, significant differences were found in smolt-to-adult survival in both rivers. In pairwise comparisons for the Ellidaar, late-migrating smolts had significantly higher survival rates than middle and early smolts. In the Vesturdalsa, late-migrating smolts had significantly higher survival than early and middle smolts, which did not differ from each other.

	abstract = {Most anadromous fish undergo physiological and behavioral changes that are preparatory and adaptive for seawater entry. In anadromous salmonids, these preparatory changes are collectively known as smolting. Smolt development is regulated by environmental factors such as photoperiod and temperature and mediated by the neuroendocrine system. In this paper, we review evidence that a variety of anthropogenic factors can influence smolt development and affect marine survival. Hatchery rearing can affect the size of smolts and the extent and timing of smolt development. Smolt development is reversible, and the period of peak physiological preparedness in salmon smolts is limited by time and temperature. By influencing temperature and the duration of the migratory period, climate change and dams will have negative effects on smolt survival beyond direct lethal impacts. Contaminants acting on developmental physiology or underlying endocrine control mechanisms can also reduce marine survival. Exposure to estrogenic compounds prior to or during smolt development can reduce seawater tolerance and preference. Acid and aluminum exposure can reverse the development of seawater tolerance and reduce adult return rates. We conclude that environmental conditions in freshwater can affect physiological development, estuarine and ocean behavior, early seawater survival, and long-term seawater growth and homing, thus having influences on adult returns and long-term population sustainability of anadromous fishes.},

	abstract = {1. Migration timing in animals has important effects on life-history transitions. Human activities can alter migration timing of animals, and understanding the effects of such disruptions remains an important goal for applied ecology. Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) inhabit fresh water as juveniles before migrating to the ocean where they gain {\textgreater}90\% of their biomass before returning to fresh water as adults to reproduce. Although construction of dams has delayed juvenile migration for many populations, we currently lack a synthesis of patterns in migration timing and how they relate to subsequent survival to adulthood for Pacific salmon, especially for at-risk populations. 2. We studied two groups of Pacific salmon from the Columbia River basin in the northwestern United States currently listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We examined how the proportion of juveniles surviving to return as adults varied with year of migration, date of arrival in the estuary, water temperature and coastal ocean upwelling using data from over 40 000 individually tagged Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. 3. In general, models with year, day and day2 had much better support from the data than those with temperature and upwelling. For Chinook salmon, we also found a residual effect of temperature after controlling for day, but the effect was small for steelhead. 4. For both species, juveniles migrating from early to mid-May survived 4{\textendash}50 times greater than those migrating in mid-June. As expected, however, the estimated peak in survival varied among years, presumably reflecting interannual variation in the nearshore physical environment and trophic dynamics that affect salmon during the critical juvenile life stage. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate a possible management objective would be to speed arrival to the estuary by increasing springtime river flows. These findings also provide some insight into the mechanisms underlying seasonal differences in survival patterns, but additional studies are needed to better resolve the issue. Future changes to river flow and water temperature associated with climate change and human activities may further alter migration timing, and thus this phenomenon deserves further attention.},

	abstract = {We review literature concerning the impacts of climate change on the migration of marine species, with an emphasis on the adaptation of migration phenology through genetic tracking and phenotypic plasticity. We then develop an individual-based modeling framework characterizing the effects of climate change on phenology and population dynamics. In the framework, an animal's ability to match its environmental preferences, its bioclimate envelope, to the environmental conditions by adjusting its migration timing between foraging and breeding habitats determines its condition, survival, and fecundity. Climate-induced changes in the envelope produce timing mismatches that result in a population adapting its phenology through both genetic and plastic processes. Model results suggest: (1) the temporal size of the bioclimate envelope is an important determinant of a population's sensitivity to climate change and susceptibility to extinction, (2) population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the timing of the envelope exceeds the rate its phenology changes or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population's inherent capacity for variability, (3) a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod is expected to exhibit weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature, and (4) population extinction in response to climate change follows a threshold pattern such that population size may not be a reliable indicator of extinction threat, although variability in average individual condition across years may be an extinction threat indicator. Finally, while the model is intentionally simplistic, we discuss how it can be extended to cover more complex interactions.},

	abstract = {The timing of migration and breeding are key life-history traits; they are not only adaptations of populations to their environments, but can serve to increase reproductive isolation, facilitating further divergence among populations. As part of a study of divergence of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, populations, established in New Zealand from a common source in the early 1900s, we tested the hypotheses that the timing of migration and breeding are under genetic control and that the populations genetically differ in these traits despite phenotypic overlap in timing in the wild. Representatives of families from two populations were collected within a day or two of each other, reared in a common environment, and then released to sea from each of two different rivers, while other family representatives were retained in fresh water to maturity. The date of maturation of fish held in fresh water and the dates of return from the ocean and maturation of fish released to sea all showed significant differences between the two populations and among families within populations. The very high heritabilities and genetic correlations estimated for migration and maturation date indicated that these traits would respond rapidly to selection. Combined with the results of related studies on these chinook salmon populations, it appears that spawning time may not only evolve during the initial phases of divergence, but it may play an important role in accelerating divergence in other traits.},

In this study, populations of the world's largest indigenous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stock were first inferred using model-based clustering methods, following which life-history and habitat variables best predicting the genetic diversity of populations were identified. This study revealed that natal homing of Atlantic salmon within the Teno River system is accurate at least to the tributary level. Generally, defining populations by main tributaries was observed to be a reasonable approach in this large river system, whereas in the mainstem of the river, the number of inferred populations was fewer than the number of distinct sampling sites. Mainstem and headwater populations were genetically more diverse and less diverged, while each tributary fostered a distinct population with high genetic differentiation and lower genetic diversity. Population structure and variation in genetic diversity among populations were poorly explained by geographical distance. In contrast, age-structure, as estimated by the proportion of multisea-winter spawners, was the most predictive variable in explaining the variation in the genetic diversity of the populations. This observation, being in agreement with theoretical predictions, emphasizes the essence of large multisea-winter females in maintaining the genetic diversity of populations. In addition, the unique genetic diversity of populations, as estimated by private allele richness, was affected by the ease of accessibility of a site, with more difficult to access sites having lower unique genetic diversity. Our results show that despite this species' high capacity for migration, tributaries foster relatively closed populations with little gene flow which will be important to consider when developing management strategies for the system.},

	abstract = {Many species are capable of facultative migration, but the relative roles of extrinsic versus intrinsic factors in generating diverse migratory tactics remain unclear. Here we explore the proximate drivers of facultative migration in brown trout in an experimental laboratory setting. The effects of reduced food, as a putative environmental cue, were examined in two populations: one that exhibits high rates of anadromy (sea-migration) in nature, and one that does not exhibit anadromy in nature. Juveniles derived from wild-caught parents were reared for two years under four environmental treatments: low food in years 1 and 2 (Low-Low); high food in years 1 and 2 (High-High), low food in year 1 and high in year 2 (Low-High), and vice versa (High-Low). Food restriction had a significant effect on migratory tactics, with the frequency of smolts (juveniles choosing migration) highest in the Low-Low treatment in both populations. No individuals became smolts in the High-High treatment, and intermediate smolting rates were observed in the Low-High and High-Low treatments. Higher overall smolting rates in the naturally anadromous population suggested an inherited component to anadromy/migration decisions, but both populations showed variability in migratory tactics. Importantly, some fish from the naturally non-anadromous population became smolts in the experiment, implying the capacity for migration was lying 'dormant', but they exhibited lower hypo-osmoregulatory function than smolts from the naturally anadromous population. Tactic frequencies in the naturally anadromous population were more affected by food in the 2nd year, while food in the 1st year appeared more important for the naturally non-anadromous population. Migratory tactics were also related to sex, but underpinned in both sexes by growth in key periods, size and energetic state. Collectively these results reveal how migration decisions are shaped by a complex interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors, informing our ability to predict how facultatively migratory populations will respond to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Time series have played a critical role in documenting how phenology responds to climate change. However, regressing phenological responses against climatic predictors involves the risk of finding potentially spurious climate-phenology relationships simply because both variables also change across years. Detrending by year is a way to address this issue. Additionally, detrending isolates interannual variation in phenology and climate, so that detrended climate-phenology relationships can represent statistical evidence of phenotypic plasticity. Using two flowering phenology time series from Colorado, USA and Greenland, we detrend flowering date and two climate predictors known to be important in these ecosystems: temperature and snowmelt date. In Colorado, all climate-phenology relationships persist after detrending. In Greenland, 75\% of the temperature-phenology relationships disappear after detrending (three of four species). At both sites, the relationships that persist after detrending suggest that plasticity is a major component of sensitivity of flowering phenology to climate. Finally, simulations that created different strengths of correlations among year, climate, and phenology provide broader support for our two empirical case studies. This study highlights the utility of detrending to determine whether phenology is related to a climate variable in observational data sets. Applying this as a best practice will increase our understanding of phenological responses to climatic variation and change.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the life history of brown trout and factors influencing decisions to migrate. Decisions that maximize fitness appear dependent on size at age. In partly anadromous populations, individuals that attain maturity at the parr stage typically become freshwater resident. For individual fish, the life history is not genetically fixed and can be modified by the previous growth history and energetic state in early life. This phenotypic plasticity may be influenced by epigenetic modifications of the genome. Thus, factors influencing survival and growth determine life history decisions. These are intra- and interspecific competition, feeding and shelter opportunities in freshwater and salt water, temperature in alternative habitats and flow conditions in running water. Male trout exhibit alternative mating strategies and can spawn as a subordinate sneaker or a dominant competitor. Females do not exhibit alternative mating behaviour. The relationship between growth, size and reproductive success differs between sexes in that females exhibit a higher tendency to migrate than males. Southern populations are sensitive to global warming. In addition, fisheries, aquaculture with increased spreading of salmon lice, introduction of new species, weirs and river regulation, poor water quality and coastal developments all threaten trout populations. The paper summarizes life history data from six populations across Europe and ends by presenting new research questions and directions for future research.},

Catchment-wide acoustic telemetry revealed silver eels quickly migrated downstream through unobstructed reaches (n = 12; mean {\pm} SD = 17.9 {\pm} 1.9 km/day). Fourteen of 17 acoustic-tagged eels detected at the pumping station (82.1\%) retreated back upstream and ten (58.8\%) passed through pumps after delays (9.5 {\pm} 11.0 days). Multi-beam sonar imaging across the intake screen (55-mm gaps) revealed that peaks in migration occurred during the nights preceding the new moon but 76.7\% retreated back upstream. All passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged eels recaptured (n = 56) downstream of a large (2.23-m diameter) mixed flow pump survived but 96.5\% had minor injuries, reduced physical condition and/or abnormal behaviour. By contrast, 64.7\% of PIT-tagged eels recaptured (n = 17) downstream of a small (0.8-m diameter) axial flow pump died. No acoustic-tagged eels that passed through the small axial flow pump (n = 10) performed onward migration at sea, unlike "control" eels released downstream (n = 11). This evidence may help develop effective remediation measures, such as operational changes, to maximise escapement of catadromous eel species at pumping stations.},

A recent UK governmental report asked: how good are seasonal forecasts on a scale of 1{\textendash}5 (where 5 is very good), and how good can we expect them to be in 30 years time? Seasonal forecasts are made from ensembles of integrations of numerical models of climate. We argue that 'goodness' should be assessed first and foremost in terms of the probabilistic reliability of these ensemble-based forecasts; reliable inputs are essential for any forecast-based decision-making. We propose that a '5' should be reserved for systems that are not only reliable overall, but where, in particular, small ensemble spread is a reliable indicator of low ensemble forecast error. We study the reliability of regional temperature and precipitation forecasts of the current operational seasonal forecast system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, universally regarded as one of the world-leading operational institutes producing seasonal climate forecasts. A wide range of 'goodness' rankings, depending on region and variable (with summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe performing exceptionally poorly) is found. Finally, we discuss the prospects of reaching '5' across all regions and variables in 30 years time.},

We considered a 15-member hindcast provided by the EC-EARTH global model (similar to ECMWF System 4, but using bias corrected SST) for the period 1991{\textendash}2012. In particular, we focus on summer mean temperature and evaluate the added value of downscaling for representation of the local climatology (mean values and extremes), improvement of model skill and performance in particular heatwave episodes. Whereas the suitability of dynamical downscaling for reducing the orographic biases of the global model depends on the region and model considered, statistical downscaling can systematically reduce errors in different order moments, from the mean to the extremes (as represented by the 95th percentile here). However, both dynamical and statistical methods lead to similar skill patterns with about the same overall performance as the global model, which shows higher values in south-eastern Europe. Therefore, no relevant added value is found in terms of model skill improvement. Finally, when focusing on the heatwaves of 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2012, the limitations of the global model to detect these hot episodes are inherited by all dynamical and statistical downscaling methods so no added value is neither found in this aspect. This work provides, to our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive intercomparison of statistical and dynamical downscaling for seasonal forecasting over Europe.},

	abstract = {The skill of seasonal precipitation forecasts is assessed worldwide-grid point by grid point-for the 40 year period 1961-2000, considering the ENSEMBLES multimodel hindcast and applying a tercile-based probabilistic approach in terms of the relative operating characteristic skill score (ROCSS). Although predictability varies with region, season, and lead time, results indicate that (1) significant skill is mainly located in the tropics-20 to 40\% of the total land areas; (2) overall, September-October (March-May) is the most (least) skillful season; and (3) the skill weakens (with respect to the 1 month lead case) at 4 months lead-especially in June-August-although the ROCSS spatial patterns are broadly preserved-particularly in Northern South America and the Malay Archipelago. The contribution of El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to this 40 year skill is also analyzed, based on the idea that the seasonal predictability may be mainly driven by El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a precipitation teleconnections and, consequently, limited by the ability of the different seasonal forecasting models to accurately reproduce them. Results show that the ROCSS spatial patterns for (1) the full period 1961-2000 and (2) El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a events are highly correlated-over 0.85. Moreover, the observed teleconnection patterns are properly simulated (predicted)-with spatial correlations around 0.8-by most of the models at both 1 and 4 months lead time.},

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Zeros (i.e. events that do not happen) are the source of two common phenomena in count data: overdispersion and zero-inflation. Zeros have multiple origins in a dataset: false zeros occur due to errors in the experimental design or the observer; structural zeros are related to the ecological or evolutionary restrictions of the system under study; and random zeros are the result of the sampling variability. Identifying the type of zeros and their relation with overdispersion and/or zero inflation is key to select the most appropriate statistical model. Here we review the different modelling options in relation to the presence of overdispersion and zero inflation, tested through the dispersion and zero inflation indices. We then examine the theory of the zero-inflated (ZI) models and the use of the score tests to assess overdispersion and zero inflation over a model. In order to choose an adequate model when analysing count data we suggest the following protocol: Step 1) classify the zeros and minimize the presence of false zeros; Step 2) identify suitable covariates; Step 3) test the data for overdispersion and zero-inflation and Step 4) choose the most adequate model based on the results of step 3 and use score tests to determine whether more complex models should be implemented. We applied the recommended protocol on a real dataset on plant-herbivore interactions to evaluate the suitability of six different models (Poisson, NB and their zero-inflated versions-ZIP, ZINB). Our data were overdispersed and zero-inflated, and the ZINB was the model with the best fit, as predicted. Ignoring overdispersion and/or zero inflation during data analyses caused biased estimates of the statistical parameters and serious errors in the interpretation of the results. Our results are a clear example on how the conclusions of an ecological hypothesis can change depending on the model applied. Understanding how zeros arise in count data, for example identifying the potential sources of structural zeros, is essential to select the best statistical design. A good model not only fits the data correctly but also takes into account the idiosyncrasies of the biological system.},

Migration was monitored in sections with different physical characteristics over a total distance of 46 km using automatic listening stations. Generally, eels quickly left the River Gudenaa (67\% within 2 days) and stayed for up to 4.3 months (mean 1.7 months) in the inner fjord. This indicates a two-step migration, with silver eels migrating out of the river in the spring, followed by a substantial residence period in the inner part of the fjord before continuing the migration. The results suggest that silver eel migration may not always be a direct journey to the ocean, but may include resident periods in coastal areas. The eels were subjected to a high mortality with less then 20\% surviving out of the fjord. Fishing seemed to be the main reason for the mortality.},

	abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is critically endangered throughout its range. Knowledge about age distribution of future spawners (silver eels) is essential to monitor the status and contribute to the recovery of this species. Determination of age in anguillid eels is challenging, especially in eels from the northern part of the distribution area where growth is slow and age at maturation can be up to 30 years or more. Eels from the river Imsa in Norway have been monitored since 1975, and this reference time series has been used to assess the stock at the European level. Population dynamics in this catchment were analyzed during the late 1980s by estimating ages on whole cleared otoliths. However, techniques for revealing annual increments on otoliths have evolved over the years sometimes yielding significant differences in age estimates. In this study, the historical otolith data were reanalyzed using a grinding and polishing method rather than reading the whole otolith. The new age estimates were considerably higher than the previous ones, sometimes by up to 29 years. Since the 1980s, mean age of silver eels only slightly increased (from 19 to 21 years in the 2010s). This was mainly due to the disappearance of younger silver eels ({\textless}15 years) in the 2010s. The new age estimates agreed with the steep decline in recruitment which occurred in the late 1980s in the Imsa catchment. Mean growth (30 mm/year, min-max: 16{\textendash}64 mm/year) has not changed since the 1980s, although density in the catchment has decreased. Revealing and reading age of slow-growing eels remain a challenge but adding a measure of otolith reading uncertainty may improve age data collection and contribute to recovery measures for this species.},

Sea trout smolt recruitments from 1992 to 1994 were the lowest recorded since 1970. The modal fork length of finnock decreased from 28 cm in 1987 to 26 cm in 1990. Up until 1989, the percentage return of smolts, as finnock, ranged from 11.4 to 32.4\%. In 1989 a minimum was reached at 1.5\%, with values of 10.0, 3.7, 7.4 and 9.9\% from 1990 to 1994. Marine survival of smolts, to total first return to fresh water, historically ranged from 19 to 66\%. Survival dropped to 1.8\% in 1989.

	abstract = {VERSION HISTORY:- On June 26, 2018 all files were republished due to the incorporation of additional observational data covering years 2014 to 2016. Prior to that date, the dataset only covered years 1979 to 2013. Data for all years prior to 2014 are identical in this and the original version of the dataset.
      DATA DESCRIPTION:The EWEMBI dataset was compiled to support the bias correction of climate input data for the impact assessments carried out in phase 2b of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b; Frieler et al., 2017), which will contribute to the 2018 IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\degreeC above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways.
      The EWEMBI data cover the entire globe at 0.5\degree horizontal and daily temporal resolution from 1979 to 2013. Data sources of EWEMBI are ERA-Interim reanalysis data (ERAI; Dee et al., 2011), WATCH forcing data methodology applied to ERA-Interim reanalysis data (WFDEI; Weedon et al., 2014), eartH2Observe forcing data (E2OBS; Calton et al., 2016) and NASA/GEWEX Surface Radiation Budget data (SRB; Stackhouse Jr. et al., 2011). The SRB data were used to bias-correct E2OBS shortwave and longwave radiation (Lange, 2018).
      Variables included in the EWEMBI dataset are Near Surface Relative Humidity, Near Surface Specific Humidity, Precipitation, Snowfall Flux, Surface Air Pressure, Surface Downwelling Longwave Radiation, Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation, Near Surface Wind Speed, Near-Surface Air Temperature, Daily Maximum Near Surface Air Temperature, Daily Minimum Near Surface Air Temperature, Eastward Near-Surface Wind and Northward Near-Surface Wind. For data sources, units and short names of all variables see Frieler et al. (2017, Table 1).},

	abstract = {Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93\% and 99\%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.},

Stages corresponded to a growth phase (stages I and II), a pre?migrant phase (III) and two migrating phases (IV and V). It is likely that an important period of growth triggered silvering through the production of growth hormone (GH) in stage III eels. In migrating eels gonad development, gonadotropin hormone (GTH?II) production and increase of eye surface were similar at all sites. Differences among locations were found in gut regression and pectoral fin length. As variability for these increased with the size of the watershed and values were highest for the most downstream locations, fin length and gut regression may indicate the time since an eel started its migration.},

	abstract = {How climate constrains species' distributions through time and space is an important question in the context of conservation planning for climate change. Despite increasing awareness of the need to incorporate mechanism into species distribution models (SDMs), mechanistic modeling of endotherm distributions remains limited in this literature. Using the American pika (Ochotona princeps) as an example, we present a framework whereby mechanism can be incorporated into endotherm SDMs. Pika distribution has repeatedly been found to be constrained by warm temperatures, so we used Niche Mapper, a mechanistic heat-balance model, to convert macroclimate data to pika-specific surface activity time in summer across the western United States. We then explored the difference between using a macroclimate predictor (summer temperature) and using a mechanistic predictor (predicted surface activity time) in SDMs. Both approaches accurately predicted pika presences in current and past climate regimes. However, the activity models predicted 8{\textendash}19\% less habitat loss in response to annual temperature increases of {\textasciitilde}3{\textendash}5 \degreeC predicted in the region by 2070, suggesting that pikas may be able to buffer some climate change effects through behavioral thermoregulation that can be captured by mechanistic modeling. Incorporating mechanism added value to the modeling by providing increased confidence in areas where different modeling approaches agreed and providing a range of outcomes in areas of disagreement. It also provided a more proximate variable relating animal distribution to climate, allowing investigations into how unique habitat characteristics and intraspecific phenotypic variation may allow pikas to exist in areas outside those predicted by generic SDMs. Only a small number of easily obtainable data are required to parameterize this mechanistic model for any endotherm, and its use can improve SDM predictions by explicitly modeling a widely applicable direct physiological effect: climate-imposed restrictions on activity. This more complete understanding is necessary to inform climate adaptation actions, management strategies, and conservation plans.},

Trout displayed a longer migration window in earlier years, which decreased over time to become more similar to the salmon migration window. On average, salmon migrated out of the river earlier than trout. Migration of both species was significantly influenced by river water temperature and water discharge, but their relative influence varied across the years. On average, body-length of smolts of both species overlapped, however, size differences were observed within the migration period and among the years. We conclude that salmon and trout smolts in this river are highly synchronised and migrate in response to the same range of linked environmental cues.},

The timing of smolt development varies among species, occurring soon after hatching in pink and chum salmon and after one to several years in Atlantic salmon. In many species the transformation is size dependent and occurs in spring, mediated through photoperiod and temperature cues. Smolt development is stimulated by several hormones including growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1, cortisol, and thyroid hormones, whereas prolactin is generally inhibitory. Increased salinity tolerance is one of the most important and tractable changes, and is caused by alteration in the function of the major osmoregulatory organs, the gill, gut, and kidney. Increased abundance of specific ion transporters (Na+/K+-ATPase, Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter and apical Cl- channel) in gill ionocytes results in increased salt secretory capacity, increased growth and swimming performance in seawater, and higher marine survival.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Skilful hydrological forecasts at sub-seasonal to seasonal lead times would
be extremely beneficial for decision-making in water resources management,
hydropower operations, and agriculture, especially during drought conditions.
Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) is a well-established method for
generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts in the absence of skilful
future meteorological predictions, instead using initial hydrologic
conditions (IHCs), such as soil moisture, groundwater, and snow, as the
source of skill. We benchmark when and where the ESP method is skilful across
a diverse sample of 314 catchments in the UK and explore the relationship
between catchment storage and ESP skill. The GR4J hydrological model was
forced with historic climate sequences to produce a 51-member ensemble of
streamflow hindcasts. We evaluated forecast skill seamlessly from lead times
of 1 day to 12 months initialized at the first of each month over a 50-year
hindcast period from 1965 to 2015. Results showed ESP was skilful against a
climatology benchmark forecast in the majority of catchments across all lead
times up to a year ahead, but the degree of skill was strongly conditional on
lead time, forecast initialization month, and individual catchment location
and storage properties. UK-wide mean ESP skill decayed exponentially as a
function of lead time with continuous ranked probability skill scores across
the year of 0.75, 0.20, and 0.11 for 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month lead times,
respectively. However, skill was not uniform across all initialization
months. For lead times up to 1 month, ESP skill was higher than average when
initialized in summer and lower in winter months, whereas for longer seasonal
and annual lead times skill was higher when initialized in autumn and winter
months and lowest in spring. ESP was most skilful in the south and east of
the UK, where slower responding catchments with higher soil moisture and
groundwater storage are mainly located; correlation between catchment base
flow index (BFI) and ESP skill was very strong (Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient=0.90 at 1-month lead time). This was in contrast to the more
highly responsive catchments in the north and west which were generally not
skilful at seasonal lead times. Overall, this work provides scientific
justification for when and where use of such a relatively simple forecasting
approach is appropriate in the UK. This study, furthermore, creates a low
cost benchmark against which potential skill improvements from more
sophisticated hydro-meteorological ensemble prediction systems can be judged.},

This prior transformation limits the heteroscedasticity of model residuals and was largely applied in criteria based on squared residuals, like the Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). In the recent years, NSE has been shown to have mathematical limitations and the Kling{\textendash}Gupta efficiency (KGE) was proposed as an alternative to provide more balance between the expected qualities of a model (namely representing the water balance,flow variability and correlation). As in the case of NSE, several authors used the KGE criterion (or its improved version KGE ) with a prior logarithmic transformation on flows. However, we show that the use of this transformation is not adapted to the case of the KGE (or KGE ) criterion and may lead to several numerical issues, potentially resulting in a biased evaluation of model performance. We present the theoretical underpinning aspects of these issues and concrete modelling examples, showing that KGE computed on logtransformed flows should be avoided. Alternatives are discussed.},

For a species experiencing global population decline, it is thus vital to better understand migration behaviour, both in the river and marine stages. Atlantic salmon smolts (n = 50) were tracked using acoustic telemetry in the River Deveron, Scotland, and adjacent coastal area. Higher rates of mortality were observed in the river (0.77\% per km) than the early marine stage of migration (0.0\% per km). Mortality likely resulted from predation. Higher swim speeds were recorded in the early marine stage compared with the river (marine = 7.37 {\pm} 28.20 km/day; river = 5.03 {\pm} 1.73 km/ day [mean {\pm} SD]), a potential predator avoidance behaviour. The majority of smolts leaving the river did so in darkness and on a flooding tide. Overall river and marine migration success were linked to nights of lower lunar brightness. Marine migration speed decreased with increasing environmental noise levels, a finding with implications for fisheries management. The migration pathway in the early marine environment did not follow obvious geographical features, such as the coastline. Thus, we suggest that early marine environment pathways are more influenced by complex water currents. These findings highlight factors that influence smolt migration survival and behaviour, areas on which future research should focus.},

	abstract = {In the global context of river fragmentation, predicting fish migration is urgent to implement management actions aimed at protecting and promoting the free movement of diadromous fish. However, large-scale applicability of conservation measures requires transferable models that enable prediction of migration even in data-poor regions. Here, we surveyed 12 contrasted European river sites to predict the activity peaks of silver eels (Anguilla anguilla) during river migration towards spawning areas through an ensemble modelling approach. Site-specific Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models were adjusted using standardized hydrological variables to predict migration probability, which were aggregated in consensus predictions. Results of independent cross-validations demonstrated that silver eel migration runs were accurately predicted in response to changes in river discharge. Transferability and predictive performance were improved by considering catchment-size dissimilarity between river sites (85 to 109,930 km2) when combining the site-specific predictions. Nevertheless, we provided two examples for which the effects of human actions on flow conditions were so high that they prevented reliable predictions of migration runs. Further contributions should thus take advantage of the flexibility of our approach for updating model collection with new sites to extend the predictive performance under a larger range of ecological conditions. Our transferable hydrological-based modelling framework offers an opportunity to implement large-scale management strategies for eel conservation, even in rivers where eel monitoring data lack. The BRT models and prediction functions were compiled in an R package named 'silvRpeak' to facilitate operational implementation by end-user managers, which can determine when mitigation measures should be implemented to improve river continuity (e.g. turbine shutdown and sluice gate opening) and balance their economic activity towards eel conservation. The only input required is discharge records that are widely available across European hydrological stations.},

Migration is therefore a process responsible for myriad ecosystem services. Many human populations depend on the presence of predictable migrations of fish for their subsistence and livelihoods. Although much research has focused on fish migration, many questions remain in our rapidly changing world. We assembled a diverse team of fundamental and applied scientists who study fish migrations in marine and freshwater environments to identify pressing unanswered questions. Our exercise revealed questions within themes related to understanding the migrating individual's internal state, navigational mechanisms, locomotor capabilities, external drivers of migration, the threats confronting migratory fish including climate change, and the role of migration. In addition, we identified key requirements for aquatic animal management, restoration, policy, and governance. Lessons revealed included the difficulties in generalizing among species and populations, and in understanding the levels of connectivity facilitated by migrating fishes.

In both river-fjord systems, there was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of returning S. salar and the mean seawater temperature at the time of smolts descending to the sea. The number of 1SW fish reported caught in River Orkla was positively correlated to the proportion of fish larvae in the post-smolt stomachs in Trondheimsfjord. The abundance of returning S.salar was, however, neither correlated to forage ratio (RF) nor other prey groups in post-smolt stomachs in the two fjord systems. In the Altafjord, the post-smolts fed mainly on pelagic fish larva (70{\textendash}98\%) and had a stable RF (0.009{\textendash}0.023) over the 6 years analysed. In the Trondheimsfjord, however, there was a higher variation in RF (0.003{\textendash}0.036), and pelagic fish larvae were dominant prey in only two (50 and 91\%) of the 8 years analysed. These 2 years also showed the highest return rates of S. salar in River Orkla. These results demonstrate that the thermal conditions experienced by post-smolts during their early sea migration may be crucial for the subsequent return rate of adults after 1{\textendash}3 years at sea. Pelagic marine fish larvae seem to be the preferred initial prey for S. salar post-smolts. As the annual variation in abundance of fish larvae is related to seawater temperature, it is proposed that seawater temperature at sea entry and the subsequent abundance of returning adult S. salar may be indirectly linked through variation in annual availability of pelagic fish larvae or other suitable food items in the early post-smolt phase.},

	abstract = {Studies of parallel evolution are seldom able to disentangle the influence of cryptic environmental variation from that of evolutionary history; whereas the unique life history of pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) presents an opportunity to do so. All pink salmon mature at age two and die after breeding. Hence, pink salmon bred in even years are completely reproductively isolated from those bred in odd years, even if the two lineages bred in same location. We used time series (mean = 7 years, maximum = 74 years) of paired even- and odd-year populations from 36 rivers spanning over 2000 km to explore parallelism in migration timing, a trait with a strong genetic basis. Migration timing was highly parallel, being determined almost entirely by local environmental differences among rivers. Interestingly, interannual changes in migration timing different somewhat between lineages. Overall, our findings indicate very strong determinism, with only a minor contribution of contingency.},

	abstract = {Researchers employing resource selection functions (RSFs) and other related methods aim to detect correlates of space-use and mitigate against detrimental environmental change. However, an empirical model fit to data from one place or time is unlikely to capture species responses under different conditions because organisms respond nonlinearly to changes in habitat availability. This phenomenon, known as a functional response in resource selection, has been debated extensively in the RSF literature but continues to be ignored by practitioners for lack of a practical treatment. We therefore extend the RSF approach to enable it to estimate generalized functional responses (GFRs) from spatial data. GFRs employ data from several sampling instances characterized by diverse profiles of habitat availability. By modeling the regression coefficients of the underlying RSF as functions of availability, GFRs can account for environmental change and thus predict population distributions in new environments. We formulate the approach as a mixed-effects model so that it is estimable by readily available statistical software. We illustrate its application using (1) simulation and (2) wolf home-range telemetry. Our results indicate that GFRs can offer considerable improvements in estimation speed and predictive ability over existing mixed-effects approaches.},

	abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) is a biologically productive Eastern Boundary Upwelling System that experiences considerable environmental variability on seasonal and interannual timescales. Given that this variability drives changes in ecologically and economically important living marine resources, predictive skill for regional oceanographic conditions is highly desirable. Here, we assess the skill of seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts in the CCS using output from Global Climate Forecast Systems in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), and describe mechanisms that underlie SST predictability. A simple persistence forecast provides considerable skill for lead times up to {\textasciitilde}4 months, while skill above persistence is mostly confined to forecasts of late winter/spring and derives primarily from predictable evolution of ENSO-related variability. Specifically, anomalously weak (strong) equatorward winds are skillfully forecast during El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) events, and drive negative (positive) upwelling anomalies and consequently warm (cold) temperature anomalies. This mechanism prevails during moderate to strong ENSO events, while years of ENSO-neutral conditions are not associated with significant forecast skill in the wind or significant skill above persistence in SST. We find also a strong latitudinal gradient in predictability within the CCS; SST forecast skill is highest off the Washington/Oregon coast and lowest off southern California, consistent with variable wind forcing being the dominant driver of SST predictability. These findings have direct implications for regional downscaling of seasonal forecasts and for short-term management of living marine resources.},

	abstract = {The overall skill of ENSO prediction in retrospective forecasts made with ten different coupled GCMs is investigated. The coupled GCM datasets of the APCC/CliPAS and DEMETER projects are used for four seasons in the common 22 years from 1980 to 2001. As a baseline, a dynamic-statistical SST forecast and persistence are compared. Our study focuses on the tropical Pacific SST, especially by analyzing the NINO34 index. In coupled models, the accuracy of the simulated variability is related to the accuracy of the simulated mean state. Almost all models have problems in simulating the mean and mean annual cycle of SST, in spite of the positive influence of realistic initial conditions. As a result, the simulation of the interannual SST variability is also far from perfect in most coupled models. With increasing lead time, this discrepancy gets worse. As one measure of forecast skill, the tier-1 multi-model ensemble (MME) forecasts of NINO3.4 SST have an anomaly correlation coefficient of 0.86 at the month 6. This is higher than that of any individual model as well as both forecasts based on persistence and those made with the dynamic-statistical model. The forecast skill of individual models and the MME depends strongly on season, ENSO phase, and ENSO intensity. A stronger El Ni{\~n}o is better predicted. The growth phases of both the warm and cold events are better predicted than the corresponding decaying phases. ENSO-neutral periods are far worse predicted than warm or cold events. The skill of forecasts that start in February or May drops faster than that of forecasts that start in August or November. This behavior, often termed the spring predictability barrier, is in part because predictions starting from February or May contain more events in the decaying phase of ENSO.},

In particular, probabilistic forecasts of surface precipitation and maximum temperature in Spain are analyzed using a high-resolution observation gridded dataset (Spain02). To this aim, a simple statistical test based on the observed and predicted tercile anomalies is used. First, the whole period 1960{\textendash}2000 is considered and it is shown that the only significant skill is found for dry events in autumn. Then, the influence of ENSO events as a potential source of conditional predictability is studied and the validation to strong La Ni{\~n}a or El Ni{\~n}o periods is restricted. Skillful seasonal predictions are found in partial agreement with the observed teleconnections derived from the historical records. On the one hand, predictability is found in spring related to El Ni{\~n}o events for dry events over the south and the Mediterranean coast and for hot events in the southeast areas. In contrast, La Ni{\~n}a drives predictability in winter for dry events over the western part and for hot events in summer over the south and the Mediterranean coast. This study considers both the direct model outputs and the postprocessed predictions obtained using a statistical downscaling method based on analogs. In general, the use of the downscaling method outperforms the direct output for precipitation, whereas in the case of the temperature no improvement is obtained.},

The somatic growth rates ranged from 15 to 62mm/year, which is typical for Ireland and other European countries. Analyses of Sr:Ca ratios along a life history transect in each otolith showed peaks (maximum more than 25\times10\textsuperscript{-3}) between the core and elver mark corresponding to the period of their leptocephalus and early glass eel stages in the ocean. Outside the elver mark, the Sr:Ca ratios indicated that eels had remained in different habitats that included freshwater (average Sr:Ca ratios, 0.98{\textendash}1.78\times10\textsuperscript{-3}) and areas with relatively high salinities (average Sr:Ca ratios, 6.73{\textendash}8.89\times10\textsuperscript{-3}). Some individuals showed clear evidence of shifts from sea to fresh waters. These findings suggest that Irish eels have the same behavioral plasticity regarding whether or not to enter freshwater or remain in marine environments as has been recently documented in this species and several other temperate anguillid species.

The migration period of Arctic char had a smaller range and less annual variation than those of the two other species, possibly partly related to their more lake-dwelling habitat preference. For all species, water flow was important in explaining day-to-day variations in smolt runs. Water flow was most important for brown trout, change in flow for Atlantic salmon, whereas photoperiod was most important for Arctic char. These results suggest that both age and size of smolts and the timing of the smolt migration have been shaped by the different habitat preferences of these species both in fresh water and sea through local selection.},

The inability of managers to anticipate environment-driven fluctuations in stock productivity or distribution can lead to overfishing and stock collapses, inflexible management regulations inducing shifts in the functional response to human predators, lost opportunities to harvest populations, bankruptcies in the fishing industry, and loss of resilience in the human food supply. Recent advances in dynamical global climate prediction systems allow for sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly predictions at a seasonal scale over many shelf ecosystems. Here we assess the utility of SST predictions at this "fishery relevant" scale to inform management, using Pacific sardine as a case study. The value of SST anomaly predictions to management was quantified under four harvest guidelines (HGs) differing in their level of integration of SST data and predictions. The HG that incorporated stock biomass forecasts informed by skillful SST predictions led to increases in stock biomass and yield, and reductions in the probability of yield and biomass falling below socioeconomic or ecologically acceptable levels. However, to mitigate the risk of collapse in the event of an erroneous forecast, it was important to combine such forecast-informed harvest controls with additional harvest restrictions at low biomass.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of some aspects of water quality to climate change was assessed in the Seine River (France) with the biogeochemical model RIVERSTRAHLER, which describes the transformations and fluxes of C, N, P and Si between the main microbiological populations, the water column and the sediment, along the entire river network. Point and diffuse sources are prescribed, stream temperature undergoes a sinusoidal annual cycle constrained by observations, and runoff is calculated by a physically-based land surface model. The reference simulation, using meteorological forcing of 1986-1990 and point sources of 1991, compares very well with observations. The climate change simulated by a general circulation model under the SRES emission scenario A2 was used to simulate the related changes in runoff and stream temperature. To this end, a statistical analysis was undertaken of the relationships between the water and air temperatures in the Seine watershed over 1993-1999, using 88 points that correctly sampled the variability of the tributaries. Most of stream temperature variance was explained by the lagged moving average of air temperature, with parameters that depended on Strahler stream order. As an interesting simplification, stream temperature changes could be approximated by air temperature changes. This modelling framework was used to analyse of the relative influence of the water warming and discharge reduction induced by climate change on biogeochemical water quality in Paris and downstream. Discharge reduction increased phytoplankton growth and oxygen deficits. Water warming decreased dissolved oxygen, increased phytoplankton biomass during the growth period, and reduced it afterwards, when loss factors dominate. It was also shown that these impacts were enhanced when point source inputs of nutrient and organic carbon increased.},

These calm, stable conditions were abruptly interrupted by a second extreme weather event, Atlantic Storm Hector, in late June. Using high-frequency monitoring data, coupled with fortnightly biological sampling, we show that the storm directly affected the stratification pattern of Lough Feeagh, resulting in an intense mixing event. The lake restabilised quickly after the storm as the heatwave continued. During the storm there was a three-fold reduction in Schmidt stability, with a mixed layer deepening of 9.5 m coinciding with a two-fold reduction in chlorophyll a but a three-fold increase in total zooplankton biomass. Epilimnetic respiration increased and net ecosystem productivity decreased. The ratio of total nitrogen:total phosphorus from in-lake versus inflow rivers was decoupled, leading to a cascade effect on higher trophic levels. A step change in nitrogen:phosphorus imbalances suggested that the zooplankton community shifted from phosphorus to nitrogen nutrient constraints. Such characterisations of both lake thermal and ecological responses to extreme weather events are relatively rare but are crucial to our understanding of how lakes are changing as the impacts of global climate change accelerate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Water temperature in lakes is governed by a complex heat budget, where the estimation of the single fluxes requires the use of several hydro-meteorological variables that are not generally available. In order to address this issue, we developed Air2Water, a simple physically based model to relate the temperature of the lake superficial layer (epilimnion) to air temperature only. The model has the form of an ordinary differential equation that accounts for the overall heat exchanges with the atmosphere and the deeper layer of the lake (hypolimnion) by means of simplified relationships, which contain a few parameters (from four to eight in the different proposed formulations) to be calibrated with the combined use of air and water temperature measurements. The calibration of the parameters in a given case study allows for one to estimate, in a synthetic way, the influence of the main processes controlling the lake thermal dynamics, and to recognize the atmospheric temperature as the main factor driving the evolution of the system. In fact, under certain hypotheses the air temperature variation implicitly contains proper information about the other major processes involved, and hence in our approach is considered as the only input variable of the model. In particular, the model is suitable to be applied over long timescales (from monthly to interannual), and can be easily used to predict the response of a lake to climate change, since projected air temperatures are usually available by large-scale global circulation models. In this paper, the model is applied to Lake Superior (USA-Canada) considering a 27 yr record of measurements, among which 18 yr are used for calibration and the remaining 9 yr for model validation. The calibration of the model is obtained by using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology, which also allows for a sensitivity analysis of the parameters. The results show remarkable agreement with measurements over the entire data period. The use of air temperature reconstructed by satellite imagery is also discussed.},

However, with a constantly growing demand for services and tools from stakeholders, not only in the water sector, we still lack simple solutions, which are easy to use for nonexperts. The new R package incorporates the BROOK90 hydrologic model and global open-source datasets used for parameterization and forcing. The aim is to estimate the vertical water fluxes within the soil\&ndash;water\&ndash;plant system of a single site or of a small catchment (\&lt;100 km2). This includes data scarce regions where no hydrometeorological measurements or reliable site characteristics can be obtained. The end-user only needs to provide a location and the desired period. The package automatically downloads the necessary datasets for elevation (Amazon Web Service Terrain Tiles), land cover (Copernicus: Land Cover 100 m), soil characteristics (ISRIC: SoilGrids250), and meteorological forcing (Copernicus: ERA5 reanalysis). Subsequently these datasets are processed, specific hydrotopes are created, and BROOK90 is applied. In a last step, the output data of all desired variables on a daily scale as well as time-series plots are stored. A first daily and monthly validation based on five catchments within various climate zones shows a decent representation of soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and runoff components. A considerably better performance is achieved for a monthly scale.},

	abstract = {Experiences of migratory species in one habitat may affect their survival in the next habitat, in what is known as carryover effects. These effects are especially relevant for understanding how freshwater experience affects survival in anadromous fishes. Here, we study the carryover effects of juvenile salmon passage through a hydropower system (Snake and Columbia rivers, northwestern United States). To reduce the direct effect of hydrosystem passage on juveniles, some fishes are transported through the hydrosystem in barges, while the others are allowed to migrate in-river. Although hydrosystem survival of transported fishes is greater than that of their run-of-river counterparts, their relative juvenile-to-adult survival (hereafter survival) can be less. We tested for carryover effects using generalized linear mixed effects models of survival with over 1 million tagged Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum) (Salmonidae), migrating in 1999{\textendash}2013. Carryover effects were identified with rear-type (wild vs. hatchery), passage-type (run-of-river vs. transported), and freshwater and marine covariates. Importantly, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index characterizing cool/warm (i.e., productive/nonproductive) ocean phases had a strong influence on the relative survival of rear- and passage-types. Specifically, transportation benefited wild Chinook salmon more in cool PDO years, while hatchery counterparts benefited more in warm PDO years. Transportation was detrimental for wild Chinook salmon migrating early in the season, but beneficial for later season migrants. Hatchery counterparts benefited from transportation throughout the season. Altogether, wild fish could benefit from transportation approximately 2 weeks earlier during cool PDO years, with still a benefit to hatchery counterparts. Furthermore, we found some support for hypotheses related to higher survival with increased river flow, high predation in the estuary and plume areas, and faster migration and development-related increased survival with temperature. Thus, pre- and within-season information on local- and broad-scale conditions across habitats can be useful for planning and implementing real-time conservation programs.},

	abstract = {A variety of movements characterize the behavioral plasticity of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in fresh water, including movements of fry from redds, establishment of feeding territories, spawning movements of sexually mature male parr, movement to and from winter habitat, and smolt migration in spring. Smolting is an adaptive specialization for downstream migration, seawater entry, and marine residence. While still in fresh water, smolts become silvery and streamlined, lose their positive rheotaxis and territoriality, and begin schooling. Physiological changes include increased salinity tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth, and altered hemoglobin and visual pigments. Through their impact on the neuroendocrine system, photoperiod and temperature regulate physiological changes, whereas temperature and water flow may initiate migration. Smolt survival is affected by a limited period of readiness (a physiological "smolt window") and the timing of seawater entry with environmental conditions such as temperature, food, and predators (an ecological "smolt window"). Smolt development is adversely affected by acidity, pollutants, and improper rearing conditions, and is often more sensitive than other life stages. Unfortunately, the migration corridor of smolts (mainstems of rivers and estuaries) are the most heavily impacted by pollution, dams, and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal or increase mortality by delaying or inhibiting smolt migration.},

Dormancy commenced in October{\textendash}November as temperatures fell below 4{\textendash}12 \degreeC. Eels tended to remain motionless throughout the winter, with some short periods of activity signalled by small changes in depth distributions.

The majority of the eels were assessed as being in the silver eel stage at the time of tagging. During the autumn months, the diving behaviour, with frequent and large vertical excursions and periods at the surface, was similar to that seen in migrating eels in the Baltic and Atlantic Ocean. In spring and summer, the behaviour differed, being dominated by more gradual depth variations, implying that the eels reverted from silver eel migration behaviour to yellow eel foraging behaviour. Body weight declined during dormancy, but other studies of starvation over comparable time periods showed significantly higher average specific weight losses, implying that the M{\"a}laren silver eels must have fed between the end of dormancy and recapture.},

The Fr{\'e}mur has a 14 m high dam which creates a 3 \times 106 m3 water supply reservoir, 6 km from tidal limit. Based on 8-year records (1996{\textendash}2004) of migrant silver eels captured in a Wolf trap located about 1 km below the dam, the influence of this dam on the migration was examined. These records indicate that 91\% of silver eels were captured when the dam was overtopped (i.e. when the water reservoir was full). The timings of the overflow periods varied greatly between years mainly because they are function of the duration of the filling period which in turn is dependent on the level of summer water abstraction and annual hydrological conditions. Consequently, migration periods occurred at variable dates (between November and April) which is late in comparison with nonobstructed European river systems (generally between August and December). During overflow periods the migration of silver eels increased markedly during rain events (increasing river flow). This indicates that flow flushes, are essential so that settled silver eels can orientate themselves and pass over the dam. The hypothesis of a 'dam effect' that could stop temporarily or permanently some of silver eels in the reservoir is discussed. Finally, the influence of the migration delays on the condition of silver eels is considered.},

Among the different techniques used for seasonal forecasting, the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) approach has long been employed due to the singular dependence on past meteorological records. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute is currently extending the use of long-range forecasts within its operational warning service, which requires a thorough analysis of the suitability and applicability of different methods with the national S-HYPE hydrological model. To this end, we aim to evaluate the skill of ESP forecasts over 39,493 catchments in Sweden, understand their spatiotemporal patterns, and explore the main hydrological processes driving forecast skill. We found that ESP forecasts are generally skilful for most of the country up to 3 months into the future but that large spatiotemporal variations exist. Forecasts are most skilful during the winter months in northern Sweden, except for the highly-regulated hydropower-producing rivers. The relationships between forecast skill and 15 different hydrological signatures show that forecasts are most skilful for slowly-reacting, baseflow-dominated catchments and least skilful for flashy catchments. Finally, we show that forecast skill patterns can be spatially clustered in 7 unique regions with similar hydrological behaviour. Overall, these results contribute to identify in which areas, seasons, and how long into the future ESP hydrological forecasts provide an added value, not only for the national forecasting and warning service but, most importantly, to guide decision-making in critical services such as hydropower management and risk reduction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A lack of knowledge on the transition from the resident to the migratory phase has led to a series of studies on the silvering process. Silvering marks the end of the sedentary growth phase and the beginning of the migratory phase. A six-stage classification was developed to describe the physiological and morphological events that occur during this metamorphosis and the subsequent migration. Stages corresponded to a growth phase (I to FII), a premigrant stage for females (FIII), and migrating stages for both sexes (FIV, FV, and MII). Here, the objective was to develop a silver index using only external measurements to assess the degree of metamorphosis of eels, based on the same data set that was used in the former study. It consisted of a large number of both resident and migratory eels that were sampled at different times of the year with different types of fishing gear and at several locations representing various types of habitats. Discriminant Analysis was applied on external measurements only: (body length, body weight, pectoral fin length, and eye diameters). Total percentage of correct reclassification into the six silvering stages was 82\%. The silver index (classification functions) was able to identify 91\% of the migratory eels. This method, associated with proper sampling, could be utilized for the quantification of potential spawners given that they all reach their spawning grounds in the Sargasso Sea.},

	abstract = {Marine aquaculture businesses are subject to a range of environmental conditions that can impact on day to day operations, the health of the farmed species, and overall production. An understanding of future environmental conditions can assist marine resource users plan their activities, minimise risks due to adverse conditions, and maximise opportunities. Short-term farm management is assisted by weather forecasts, but longer term planning may be hampered by an absence of useful climate information at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we use dynamical seasonal forecasts to predict water temperatures for south-east Tasmanian Atlantic salmon farm sites several months into the future. High summer temperatures pose a significant risk to production systems of these farms. Based on twenty years of historical validation, the model shows useful skill (i.e., predictive ability) for all months of the year at lead-times of 0{\textendash}1months. Model skill is highest when forecasting for winter months, and lowest for December and January predictions. The poorer performance in summer may be due to increased variability due to the convergence of several ocean currents offshore from the salmon farming region. Accuracy of probabilistic forecasts exceeds 80\% for all months at lead-time 0months for the upper tercile (warmest 33\% of values) and exceeds 50\% at a lead-time of 3months. This analysis shows that useful information on future ocean conditions up to several months into the future can be provided for the salmon aquaculture industry in this region. Similar forecasting techniques can be applied to other marine industries such as wild fisheries and pond aquaculture in other regions. This future knowledge will enhance environment-related decision making of marine managers and increase industry resilience to climate variability.},

In eastern Australian waters, southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii ) are a quota-limited species in a multispecies longline fishery; minimizing capture by nonquota holders is an important management concern. A habitat preference model (conditioned with electronic tag data) coupled with ocean reanalysis data has been used since 2003 to generate real-time predicted maps of SBT distribution (nowcasts). These maps are used by fishery managers to restrict fisher access to areas with high predicted SBT distribution. Here we use the coupled ocean-atmosphere model, POAMA (predictive ocean atmosphere model for Australia), and a habitat model to forecast SBT distribution at lead times of up to 4 months. These forecasts are comparable with nowcasts derived from the operational system, and show skill in predicting SBT habitat boundaries out to lead-times of 3{\textendash}4 months. For this fishery, seasonal forecasts can provide managers and fishers with valuable insights into future habitat distributions for the upcoming months, to better inform operational decisions.},

Submerged video cameras provided information on the exact timing and intensity of both migrations in a natural river channel, without disturbing the fish. In contrast to the mainly nocturnal migration pattern described from temperate rivers, the River Utsjoki smolts and adults migrated throughout the day. Smolts migrated most intensively during hours of rising (0300{\textendash}0900 hours) and high sun (0900{\textendash}1500 hours), while adults favoured the period of low sun (2100{\textendash}0300 hours). Smolt migrations started in June and lasted on average 42 days. Adults usually ascended the site 2{\textendash}3 weeks before the first descending smolts were observed and the adult migrations extended to the end of August. Seasonal synchrony was observed between smolt and adult migrations in years of slowly warming water, whereas in a year of exceptionally warm early summer (2002), smolts migrated earlier than adults. Thus, water temperature seemed to be an important environmental factor triggering the smolt migration, while the migration of adults was probably more fixed to a certain season. Weak positive correlations between fish counts and water temperature were observed, indicating that increasing water temperature may have promoted both smolt and adult migrations. The influence of discharge was negligible, although increasing discharge late in the season may have activated the remaining individuals in both groups.},

We explored how well environmental indices (at multiple locations and time lags) explained performance of forecasts based on different methods (i.e. sibling-based, production-based, environment-based, or recent averages), testing for nonlinear threshold dynamics. For the California stocks, no index tested explained \&gt;50\% of the variation in forecast performance, but spring Pacific Decadal Oscillation and winter North Pacific Index during the year of return explained \&gt;40\% of the variation for the sibling-based Sacramento Fall Chinook forecast, with nonlinearity and apparent thresholds. This suggests that oceanic conditions experienced by adults (after younger siblings returned) have the most impact on sibling-based forecasts. For Puget Sound stocks, we detected nonlinear/threshold relationships explaining \&gt;50\% of the variation with multiple indices and lags. Environmental influences on preseason forecasts may create biases that render salmon fisheries management more or less conservative, and therefore could motivate the development of ecosystem-based risk assessments.},

	abstract = {The Sacramento River is the largest river in California, and an important source of water for agricultural, municipal, and industrial users. Input to the Sacramento River comes from Shasta Lake and is controlled by operators of Shasta Dam, who are challenged with meeting the competing needs of these users while also maintaining a cold water habitat for Endangered Species Act (ESA) listed winter-run Chinook salmon. The cold water habitat goals are constrained by the volume of cold water storage in the lake, which operators attempt to selectively deploy throughout the critical late summer/fall window. To make informed decisions about the release of this limited cold water resource, skillful forecasts of downstream water temperature attributes at the seasonal time scale are crucial. To this end, we offer a generalized linear modeling (GLM) framework with a local polynomial method for function estimation, to provide predictions of a range of daily water temperature attributes (maximum daily water temperature, daily temperature range, number of hours of threshold exceedance, and probability of threshold exceedance/nonexceedance). These attributes are varied in nature (i.e., discrete, continuous, categorical, etc.), and the GLM provides a general framework to modeling all of them. A suite of predictors that impact water temperatures are considered, including current and prior day flow, water temperature of upstream releases, air temperature, and precipitation. A two-step model selection is proposed. First, an objective method based on Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) is used in a global model to select the best set of predictors for each attribute; then the parameters of the local polynomial method for the selected best set of predictors are obtained using generalized cross validation (GCV). Daily weather ensembles from stochastic weather generators are coupled to the GLM models to provide ensembles of water temperature attributes and consequently, the probability distributions to obtain risk estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by modeling water temperature attributes for a temperature compliance point on the Sacramento River below Shasta Dam. Regulations on the dam depress the water temperature forecasting skill; to show this, we present skillful results from applying the approach to an unregulated location in the Pacific Northwest. The proposed method is general, can be ported across sites, and can be used in climate change studies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001023. copyright 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), migrating to sea encounter many man-made structures that can hamper and delay migration or induce mortality. Three pumping stations in Friesland, the Netherlands, were covered with acoustic receivers. Ninety-three silver eels tagged with acoustic transmitters were released in the polders upstream of the stations and 89\% were detected passing a pumping station. The majority of silver eels passed the stations within a day after arriving at the station. Four silver eels stayed for longer than 2 weeks before passage, and 18 were detected at the receiver downstream the pumping station for more than one day, with detections up to several weeks. These detections probably indicated a dead eel, but could also indicate a live eel remaining at the site. Most of the silver eels passed the pumping stations within a day after release, so fish-friendly pumps will benefit the migrating population most. In the Netherlands, there are several thousand pumping stations. Installing fish passages near these stations is not feasible due to high costs. Prioritising all these sites in relation to the degree of blockage, mortality rates and its relative importance for migratory fish, can maximise the effectiveness of measures and mitigation taken.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of climate information for agricultural risk management hinges on its availability and relevance to the producer when climate-sensitive decisions are being made. Climate information providers are challenged with the task of balancing forecast availability and lead time with acceptable forecast skill, which requires an improved understanding of the timing of agricultural decision making. Achieving a useful balance may also require an expansion of inquiry to include use of non-forecast climate information (i.e. historical climate information) in agricultural decision making. Decision calendars have proven valuable for identifying opportunities for using different types of climate information. The extent to which decision-making time periods are localized versus generalized across major commodity-producing regions is yet unknown, though, which has limited their use in climate product development. Based on a 2012 survey of more than 4770 agricultural producers across the U.S. Corn Belt region, we found variation in the timing of decision-making points in the crop year based on geographic variation as well as crop management differences. Many key decisions in the cropping year take place during the preceding fall and winter, months before planting, raising questions about types of climate information that might be best inserted into risk management decisions at that time. We found that historical climate information and long term climate outlooks are less influential in agricultural risk management than current weather, short term forecasts, or monthly climate projections, even though they may, in fact, be more useful to certain types of decision making.},

Typically "connect-the-dots" linear interpolation is used to impute missed passage; however, this method fails to characterize uncertainty about estimates and cannot be implemented when the tails of a run are missed. Here, we present a statistical approach to imputing missing passage at weirs that addresses these shortcomings, consisting of a parametric run curve model to describe the smoothed arrival dynamics of a fish population and a process variation model to describe the likelihood of observed data. Statistical arrival models are fit in a Bayesian framework and tested with a suite of missing data simulation trials and against a selection of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) case studies from the Yukon River drainage, Alaska, USA. When compared against linear interpolation, statistical arrival models produced equivalent or better expected accuracy and a narrower range of bias outcomes. Statistical arrival models also successfully imputed missing passage counts for scenarios where the tails of a run were missed.},

	abstract = {'Trap and transport' (T\&T) is employed to facilitate the seaward migration of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) past obstacles such as hydropower facilities. Hence, previous studies assessing its efficacy have focussed on disrupted fluvial systems. The transferability of findings from lotic to lentic systems is uncertain because many of the environmental cues that trigger eel migration in rivers are lacking from reservoirs and lakes, particularly those with limited flow connection to the surrounding catchment. We used acoustic telemetry to compare the migration behaviour of T\&T adult A. anguilla which were fyke netted and transported from two disconnected reservoirs (n=80) to a control group of resident river eel (n=30) during their migration through the lower River Stour, UK, to the North Sea. Migration patterns and behaviour were broadly similar between the reservoir T\&T eel and river eel with 86 and 90 \% of each group successfully reaching the sea, respectively. Reservoir eel were larger and at a more advanced stage of migratory readiness (silvering) and commenced migration sooner after release than the river eel, but they descended the catchment at a slower rate. Behaviour in the estuary was highly variable between individuals with residence times ranging from 5 h to 83 days (median = 1.4 days) across all groups. Only one individual failed to migrate through the estuary and most (75 \%) reached the sea within five days of entering the estuary. Findings indicate that T\&T of adult eel from reservoirs represents a feasible method to allow landlocked individuals to migrate and potentially contribute to the spawning stock, either now or in the future. Results also highlighted the high capture effort that may be required to implement an effective T\&T programme. Gaining a thorough understanding of eel abundance and population structure in the source waterbody is desirable before implementation.},

	abstract = {Hydropower plants are commonly reported as a major cause of the worldwide decline of freshwater eels (Anguillidae), so that management solutions are urgently needed to mitigate their impacts. Where downstream passage solutions are complex to develop, turbine shutdown appears as an effective management solution to protect silver eels during their river migration toward spawning areas. However, the definition of operational decision rules for turbine shutdown is challenging due to the duality between the benefit for eel conservation and the concomitant cost in term of hydropower production. Here, we proposed a decision framework for turbine shutdown based on simple hydrological criteria to guide negotiations between stakeholders toward a trade-off between silver eel escapement and hydropower generation. Eel migration was assumed to be triggered by a minimum river flow associated with a minimum discharge pulse, so that threshold values can be directly implemented as decision rules for turbine shutdown. To estimate relevant thresholds, a generic methodological framework was developed to generate alternative decision rules from data collected at hydropower plants, which can include telemetry surveys and estimates of eel abundance. A multiple-criteria decision analysis was then conducted to rank alternatives and to determine the best compromise between promoting silver eel escapement and limiting turbine shutdown duration. Graphic outputs can help stakeholders to understand the competitive interests between eel conservation and hydropower production, while visually identifying a range of consensual alternatives to support negotiations in the choice of operational thresholds. The method was illustrated for three river systems in Europe featured by distinct hydrological conditions and can be applied in other areas, providing that eel monitoring surveys and flow data are available.},

Muscle fat concentrations varied both within and between localities and lean eels with muscle fat concentrations {\textless}20\% occurred at all study sites. Furthermore, no correlation could be found between muscle fat content and internal or external maturation indices, neither was the relative liver size related to the maturation process, as the correlation between the hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices was very weak. Consequently, it was concluded that silvering and the spawning migration may begin also at low muscle fat concentrations. However, most of the energy reserve is stored as muscle fat in eel, and it is highly unlikely that female silver eels with such low fat contents, as were observed occasionally in this study, will ever recruit to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that the maturation process in eel is more flexible than previously recognized, and that this process might be temporarily arrested and feeding resumed during the first part of the migratory phase.},

A clear dominant nocturnal migration was demonstrated early in the migration period, later becoming increasingly diurnal, until rates became approximately equal at day and night. Migration patterns were related to water temperature, such that when mean daily temperatures were below 12 \degreeC, hourly rates of migration were significantly lower during the day than at night. When daily mean temperatures exceeded 12 \degreeC, there was no significant difference between diurnal and nocturnal migration rates. Migration patterns showed a distinct suppression of migration at dawn and dusk throughout the migration period. It is hypothesised that this behaviour is an active decision and/or an adaptive strategy either to take advantage of increased food in the form of invertebrate drift or to reduce predation risk from actively feeding piscivores or both.},

The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5\degree spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing.

We examined an unexploited population of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) from a West of Ireland catchment. The population is long-lived and slow-growing compared to many other European eel populations. Von Bertalanffy growth curves showed decadal changes, with a trend towards larger K, and t0 values in both males and females and a smaller L1 in females. A growth biochronology spanning seven decades (1950s{\textendash}2010s) was constructed using otolith annual increment measurements. We found evidence of high variability in growth over the course of the time series. A decrease in growth occurred after the early 2000s, potentially driven by habitat and climatic changes. Growth was negatively correlated with early spring and winter temperatures, providing strong evidence that the length of the growing season impacts eel growth. Growth was also positively correlated with summer temperatures and the number of days that exceeded 16\degreeC (GSL16\degreeC). The response to temperature was age-dependent; at age one the positive relationship with GSL16\degreeC was most pronounced and the negative relationship with winter temperatures was not evident. This study demonstrates the impact of climate change and highlights the complexities of eel growth strategies in a changing environment.},

	abstract = {Despite the significant advances in making monthly or seasonal forecasts of weather, ocean hypoxia, harmful algal blooms and marine pathogens, few such forecasting efforts have extended to the ecology of upper trophic level marine species. Here, we test our ability to use short-term (up to 9 months) predictions of ocean conditions to create a novel forecast of the spatial distribution of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax. Predictions of ocean conditions are derived using the output from the Climate Forecast System (CFS) model downscaled through the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we estimated significant relationships between sardine presence in a test year (2009) and salinity and temperature. The model, fitted to 2009 data, had a moderate skill [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.67] in predicting 2009 sardine distributions, 5{\textendash}8 months in advance. Preliminary tests indicate that the model also had the skill to predict sardine presence in August 2013 (AUC = 0.85) and August 2014 (AUC = 0.96), 4{\textendash}5 months in advance. The approach could be used to provide fishery managers with an early warning of distributional shifts of this species, which migrates from the U.S.-Mexico border to as far north as British Columbia, Canada, in summers with warm water and other favorable ocean conditions. We expect seasonal and monthly forecasts of ocean conditions to be broadly useful for predicting spatial distributions of other pelagic and midwater species.},

	abstract = {Forecasting distribution shifts under novel environmental conditions is a major task for ecologists and conservationists. Researchers forecast distribution shifts using several tools including: predicting from an empirical relationship between a summary of distribution (population centroid) and annual time series ("annual regression," AR); or fitting a habitat-envelope model to historical distribution and forecasting given predictions of future environmental conditions ("habitat envelope," HE). However, surprisingly little research has estimated forecast skill by fitting to historical data, forecasting distribution shifts and comparing forecasts with subsequent observations of distribution shifts. I demonstrate the important role of retrospective skill testing by forecasting poleward movement over 1-, 2- or 3-year periods for 20 fish and crab species in the Eastern Bering Sea and comparing forecasts with observed shifts. I specifically introduce an alternative vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) forecasting model, which can include species temperature responses, and compare skill for AR, HE and VAST forecasts. Results show that the HE forecast has 30\%{\textendash}43\% greater variance than predicting that future distribution is identical to the estimated distribution in the final year (a "persistence" forecast). Meanwhile, the AR explains 2\%{\textendash}6\% and VAST explains 8\%{\textendash}25\% of variance in poleward movement, and both have better performance than a persistence forecast. HE and AR both generate forecast intervals that are too narrow, while VAST models with or without temperature have appropriate width for forecast intervals. Retrospective skill testing for more regions and taxa should be used as a test bed to guide future improvements in methods for forecasting distribution shifts.},

Here, we analysed observational data from eight European lakes and investigated the changes in annual minimum surface water temperature. We found that between 1973 and 2014, the annual minimum lake surface temperature has increased at an average rate of +0.35 \degree C decade\textsuperscript{-1}, comparable to the rate of summer average lake surface temperature change during the same period (+ 0.32 \degreeC decade\textsuperscript{-1}). Coherent responses to climatic warming are observed between the increase in annual minimum lake surface temperature and the increase in winter air temperature variations. As a result of the rapid warming of annual minimum lake surface temperatures, some of the studied lakes no longer reach important minimum surface temperature thresholds that occur in winter, with complex and significant potential implications for lakes and the ecosystem services that they provide.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the assessment of silver European eel (Anguilla anguilla) escapement based on a "sedentary" population fraction analysis in a 60-km2 watershed of northern Brittany (France). Downstream migration fluxes were monitored using eel traps and related to environmental factors. Intensive electrofishing and fyke-net fishing were conducted to assess eel biomass, densities, and population structure. A total of 564 eels, including 81 silver eels, were PIT tagged. In 1996, 616 eels were caught in the catchment including 68 silver eels (11\%). During the following downstream migration period, 12 of the PIT-tagged silver eels, among a total of 678, were recaptured in the downstream traps. Seven were recaptured in the catchment in 1997. It was shown that (i) only about 20\% of the silver eels present in the catchment emigrated during the following year, (ii) 12\% stayed in the catchment including two (3.4\%) that recovered yellow eel characteristics, and (iii) the other eels either died or settled in the catchment but were not recaptured. It was also estimated that 2\% (650 eels) of the population (34 000 eels) among 3000 silver eels considered "emigration candidates" emigrated each year,.},

	abstract = {Estimation of silver eel production, Anguilla anguilla L., is fundamental for the management of eel stocks. In the hydropower-regulated rivers Shannon and Erne, Ireland, production is calculated using catch data from a conservation trap and transport programme. However, in both rivers gaps in silver eel catch datasets tend to occur, which can lead to biases in production estimates. Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to model daily catch in these rivers based on a variety of environmental variables. Final models for the Shannon and Erne explained 83.7\% and 78.8\% of deviance in daily catch, respectively. A second model on the Erne included catch from a nearby fishing site in an attempt to increase explanatory power and explained 91.7\% of deviance. Although model accuracy was increased, reliance on catch from another site may limit the applicability of the model. Model predictions were combined with estimates of fishing efficiency to predict production for the Shannon (36,210 kg; 0.85 kg/ha) and Erne (66,899{\textendash}67,047 kg; 2.55{\textendash}2.56 kg/ha). These values represented a 9.3\% and 2.8\%{\textendash}3.0\% increase on production estimated from incomplete catch records alone for the Shannon and Erne, respectively.},

	abstract = {The relationship between smolt status and downstream movement following release was investigated in two stocks of hatchery-reared anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta). Yearlings from a domesticated stock (DS) and firstgeneration offspring (F1) of wild anadromous trout were held under identical conditions from August 1997 until the following spring, where they developed smolt characteristics as judged from increasing gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Presmolts (low Na+,K+-ATPase activity), smolts (high Na+,K+-ATPase activity), and desmolts (regressed Na+,K+-ATPase activity) were released on three occasions into the River Salten. Using both dye-marked and radiotagged fish, downstream movement was monitored by either trapping 3 km downstream (dye-marked fish) or radiotracking on a daily basis. The experiments showed a positive correlation between smolt status (gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity) and downstream movement. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity may therefore be used as an indicator of migratory readiness in brown trout. F1 and DS trout had the highest migration frequency when released as presmolts and smolts, respectively. Despite smaller size, F1 trout had similar or better survival than DS trout after release. Our data suggest that initiation of downstream movement is influenced by an interaction between the previous physiological development of the fish and a discrete level of water discharge or water temperature.},
